    <<~EOS
      ðŸ“¦ MonitorPicker config files were installed to:

          #{libexec}

      âœ… To finish setup, run this command:

          /bin/bash -c "$(brew --prefix)/opt/monitorpicker/setup.sh"

      ðŸ“Œ This will copy files to ~/.hammerspoon/monitorpicker and prompt you to update ~/.hammerspoon/init.lua

      Or you can do it manually:

          mkdir -p ~/.hammerspoon/monitorpicker
          cp #{libexec}/init.lua ~/.hammerspoon/monitorpicker/
          cp #{libexec}/monitor_picker.lua ~/.hammerspoon/monitorpicker/

      Then add this to your ~/.hammerspoon/init.lua if not already present:

          require("monitorpicker")

      ðŸš€ Reload Hammerspoon and enjoy!
